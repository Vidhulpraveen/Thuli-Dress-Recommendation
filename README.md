# Dress Recommendation

The goal of this project is to develop an interactive web application that examines an uploaded image of a person and the chosen occasion (such as casual, formal, red carpet, party, or wedding) to deliver personalized outfit suggestions through both text and images. 

This includes recommendations for tops (torso), bottoms (pants), and suitable accessories for the occasion.
